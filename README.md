# My Berlin Recommendations

My Berlin Recommendations is a website that gives people my favourite choices of where to go in Berlin. 
From attractions, restaurants and accommodation and the map of Berlin shows my favourite places out of the sections above. 

# UX

The website is designed for anyone that is interested to travel to Berlin. 
Within the website I created and use the Google Maps API 
to showcase my top selections in Berlin.

The site shows the following:

Attractions
Accommodations
Restaurants

I provide search results in a manner that is visually appealing for website users. 

## Demo

# Testing

* Throughout the building of the website, I checked each link internal and external would work. 
* Responsive design was checked with adjusting the window size and toggle device toolbar. 

#### Map testing
* The code was taken from google map API 
* I took some of the working functions from map HTML test and added them in.
* I set about getting the lat and long for each place and placing markers on the map. 
* Adding buttons that would link to the markers ensure a reset button. 
* Correcting the zoom and setting the zoom center for seeing all the cluster locations.
* Adding the search button was the last step.
